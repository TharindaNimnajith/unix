UNIX is a multi-user and multi-tasking operating system.


UNIX operating system consists of 3 main components.
	1. Kernel - Allocates memory & time to programs, Handle file store & communications in response to system calls
	2. Shell - Interface between user and kernel
	3. Program - Set of instructions to be executed


UNIX operating system is based on 3 philosophies.
	1. Simplicity
		- Large number of simple applications instead of few complex ones
		- Increases efficiency
		- Less wastage of system resources
		- Each program does one thing well
	2. Reusability
		- Consisting of large number of simple and small components
	3. Portability
		- Open source nature


UNIX command syntax: $ command [options] [arguments]
